Difference between Directive include and action include
--------------------------------------------------
1.Java file is creating only for source jsp file in directive include 
but in action for both source and destination.
2.We can declare variable in one file and we can print it in another file
in case of directive but not in action include.
3.We cannot give the file name by variable in case of directive include
but in action.
4.We can not make jsp to servlet call in case of directive include
but in action include.
